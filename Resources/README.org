main.js is built from a npm project using [[https://webpack.js.org/][webpack]]

The npm project contains only the [[https://github.com/orgapp/orgajs][orga package]] and a file that looks like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC
"use strict";
const orgaModule = require("orga");
global.parse = orgaModule.parse;
#+END_SRC

Webpack was run without configuration.
